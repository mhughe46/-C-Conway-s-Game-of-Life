# Conway's Game of Life
 
This is a program to simulate Conway's Game of Life, a set of rules meant to demonstrate how complexity can emerge from simplicity. The program also has a toggleable UI to display the controls for pausing the simulation, panning around the world and zooming in and out. I wrote the code for this program in C++ using SDL2 as the main framework.

# How to Play
To run the program simply run Build/Game Of Life.exe
